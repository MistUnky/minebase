Poll
----

Every user with at least ten Posts is allowed to vote once for every mod. This 
means you should only vote for those mods you want to be included. I am going 
to keep track of the votes in "minebase/misc/poll.csv". In order to vote use + 
followed by the mod name. You can vote for unlisted mods.
+ Modname

I am going to add votes from every reply once and they are final. If you edit 
the reply afterwards, I am not going to change the recorded votes. I also 
won't change them on request. You are able to vote for different mods in 
different replies.
These rules are important because they make it easy to organize this long-term
poll. 

Not every vote counts the same in this poll. The significance of your vote 
depends on the amount of posts you have created at the time I record it. The 
following table shows the thresholds.

Posts	| Significance
-------:|-------------:
10	| 1
100	| 2
1000	| 3
10000	| 4
100000	| 5
...	| ...

The amount of posts represent the time you have spent talking about Minetest.
I want those who have been around longer and saw the development of Minetest 
to have more influence on the outcome.
