# Minebase


This project uses a modified version of [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for 
version numbers. In addition to a major, minor and patch number there is a 
year number. On every birthday this number is incremented and all other numbers 
are reset to 0 (Year.Major.Minor.Patch).
The birthday is the day of my first commit to this repository on Nov 1 2020. It
was a Sunday at 12:27:53 to be exact.
